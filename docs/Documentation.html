<h1>How does it work ?</h1>
The intention of Elucidate, is to make it easier and clearer on how to use the <a href="http://snapraid.sourceforge.net/manual.html">
SnapRAID</a> Command-line application.<br>
Lets take a look at the layout:<br>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Windows 7 x64 </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img title="Layout With Scheduling.png" alt="Layout With Scheduling.png" src="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=elucidate&DownloadId=334491"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h1><u>Menu</u></h1>
<h3><a href="/elucidate/wikipage?title=Settings&referringTitle=Documentation">Settings</a></h3>
This will hold the preferences that have been setup for this application.<br>
It will need to know the location of the SnapRAID executable.<br>
On the first run this form will show and ask the user to fill in this location before enabling any of the buttons.<br>
It also needs to generate or locate the config file for SnapRAID to use. Without this, SnapRAID will not work as expected.
<i>More on this later.</i>
<h3>View Log</h3>
This will start up a viewer to look at the log files that Elucidate generates during it's processing. On Windows this will be WordPad.
<h3>Help</h3>
A brief intro, probably this page :-)
<h1><u>Buttons</u></h1>
<h3><u>D</u>ifferences</h3>
This will switch to the Real-Time View and then run the &quot;diff&quot; command. It will list all the file changes that have occurred since the last
<u>S</u>ync command.
<h3><u>S</u>ync</h3>
This will generate or refresh (synchronize) the snapshot parity data sets.
<h3><u>C</u>heck</h3>
If will read all your data, to check if it's correct.<br>
If an error is found, you can use the &quot;fix&quot; command to fix it.
<h3>Real-time View</h3>
This is a tail of the current data being written to the log view.<br>
It is marked up with colors to show the type of logging; So if you see red in the middle of a run, then that's probably bad!<br>

<h3>Status Bar</h3>

The left side shows the locale time stamp Followed by the current status. </p>
<p>This can also be used to <strong>Use Idle / Pause / Abort / Reset</strong> back to Running, the current SnapRaid process.
</p>
<p>The right show the progress percentages that come from SnapRAID.</p>
